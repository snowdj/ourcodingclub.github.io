__Following from our first tutorial on <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/01/29/datavis.html" target="_blank">intro to data visualisation using `ggplot2`</a>, we are now back for more `ggplot2` practice and customisation. The ultimate aim of this tutorial is to help you to make your figures even more beautiful - and even more informative! Since, unfortunately, it seems to be the case that no two figures are ever the same, that means that the ability to customise figures is key!__

## Downloading data 

We will use made-up data consisting of the abundance and height of different plant species occurring in two magic lands - Hogsmeade and Narnia. 

### The imaginary data for this tutorial can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-10-DataVis2" target="_blank">this repository.</a> 
Clone and download the repo as a zipfile, then unzip and set the folder as your working directory by running the code below (subbing in the actual folder path), or clicking `Session/ Set Working Directory/ Choose Directory` from the RStudio menu.

Alternatively, you can fork <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-10-DataVis2" target="_blank">the repository</a>  to your own Github account and then add it as a new RStudio project by copying the HTTPS/SSH link. For more details on how to register on Github, download Git, sync RStudio and Github and use version control, please check out our previous <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html" target="_blank">tutorial.</a>

Make a new script file using `File/ New File/ R Script` and we are all set to explore how plant communities have changed in our magical lands - Hogsmeade and Narnia.

```r
# Load libraries ----
library(dplyr)  # For data manipulation
library(ggplot2)  # For data visualisation
library(nlme)  # For mixed effects models

setwd("PATH_TO_FOLDER")  # Set to the folder where you saved the data

# Read in data ----
magic_veg <- read.csv("magic_veg.csv")
```

We will first explore our dataset using the `str()` function which shows what type each variable is - what is the dataset made of?

```r
str(magic_veg)

# land - the location within the land of magic (two possible lands, Narnia and Hogsmeade)
# plot - the plot number within each land
# year - the year the measurement was taken
# species - the species name (or code) - note that these are fake species!
# height - the imaginary canopy height at that point
# id - the id of each observation
```

<a name="hist"></a>

## 1. Customising histograms in `ggplot2`

We'll start by revisiting some of the types of plots we can make with `ggplot2`.

Let us first find out how many species there are in each plot. 

```r
species_counts <- magic_veg %>%
  group_by(land, plot) %>%
  summarise(Species_number = length(unique(species)))
```

Using what we've learnt from the previous data visualization tutorial, we run the following code to create the histogram. 

```r
(hist <- ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot)) +
  geom_histogram())
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/histwrong1.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/> </center>

This is the common way of making a histogram, but you can immediately see that it doesn't look right.  That's because you want to tell R that you already know how many species are in each plot. You do that with the following code chunk. 

Are you unable to see your graph in your plots window pane? Maybe you've forgotten to put the brackets around the ggplot code chunk - you've made your graph, but it hasn't been visualized, because we haven't "called" the object in R. You do that by putting everything in brackets. 

```r
(hist <- ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "identity"))
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/histwrong2.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/> </center>

That looks a bit better, but it still seems to have far too many species - and it's because plots from each land are being grouped together. We can separate them, and make a stacked bar plot like this. 

```r
(hist <- ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity"))
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/histwrong3.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/> </center>

But if we want to make the columns such that its not stacked, you add `position = "dodge"` to your code. 

```r
(hist <- ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "identity", position = "dodge"))
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/histbase.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/> </center>

Note how our figure only shows plot numbers 2, 4, 6. If we want to add the axis labels such that it labels every plot number, 1 - 6, you run the following code by using `breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)` or using `breaks = 1:6`. We can also specify the limits of the plot axes - running the code below, you'll be able to see that the limit of the y axis now extends to the value of 50! This helps us keep all our data within the axis labels that we have, in terms of the visualization!

```r
(hist <- ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)) + 
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50)))
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/histbase2.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/> </center>

<a name="labs"></a>

## 2. Adding titles, subtitles, captions and axis labels 

Now it's time for us to add more information to our graphs, for example, the plot title, subtitle, caption and axis labels. This might not be so useful in this case, but here's some guidance just in case you do require this in your own work. Something to note is that we have `x = "\n X AXIS LABEL"` and `y = "Y AXIS LABEL \n"` here. What the `\n` does is that it adds a line between the label and the axes, allowing my plot to have some space to breathe. Try removing the `\n` to see the difference that it makes! 

```r
(hist <- ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)) + 
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50)) +
    labs(title = "Species richness by plot", 
         subtitle = "In the magical lands",
         caption = "Data from the Ministry of Magic", 
         x = "\n Plot number", y = "Number of species \n"))
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/histbeaut1a.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/> </center>

You can also add in `theme()` to your plot, where you now have more things that you can customise. Here, we're showing you how to change the font sizes of the axis label (axis text), axis title and plot title. Other things you can do is to italicize or bold the text with `face = "italic"` or `face = "bold"` respectively. If we wanted to have our plot title in the middle of the figure, we use `hjust = 0.5` to specify that too. 

Note that if we wanted to specify different options for the x and y axis, we can use `axis.text.x` or `axis.title.x` and `axis.text.y` or `axis.title.y` and specify the characteristics for each axis. 

```r
(hist <- ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)) + 
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50)) +
    labs(title = "Species richness by plot", 
         x = "\n Plot number", y = "Number of species \n") + 
    theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
          axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "italic"), 
          plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5, face = "bold")))
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/histbeaut1b.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/> </center>

<a name="panel"></a>

## 3. Changing the plot background 

All our graphs at the moment have the grey background in the plot, and that doesn't look great. It also has both major and minor grid lines for both the y and x axes, which we might want to remove to have a clear plain white background for the plot. Adding `theme_bw()` to our plot removes the grey background, and it is now white. There are various other themes built into RStudio, but we personally think this is the cleanest one. 

To remove the grid lines, we add the code `panel.grid = element_blank()`. Just as how `axis.text` encompasses `axis.text.x` and `axis.text.y` we discussed above, `panel.grid` encompasses a load of options: `panel.grid.major`, which in turn governs `panel.grid.major.x` and `panel.grid.major.y` and the same for `panel.grid.minor`! 

```r
(hist <- ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)) + 
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50)) +
    labs(title = "Species richness by plot", 
         x = "\n Plot number", y = "Number of species \n") + 
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), 
          axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
          axis.title = element_text(size = 12), 
          plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5, face = "bold")))
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/histbeaut2.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/> </center>

<a name="legend"></a>

## 4. Fixing the legend and customizing colours 

Notice how the name of our legend is now currently "land" - the title of that column in our dataframe of species_counts. It is both not very informative, and the "l" is not capitalized. We're able to change that to "Land of Magic" by specifying its `name` in the function `scale_fill_manual` by specifying `name = "Land of Magic"`. In some cases, we might not want to have a title for the legend, and you can do that by specifying in `scale_fill_manual`, `name = NULL`. 

In this function, we can also specify the values of the colours that we want: we can do this either by specifying one of R's in built colours (e.g. in this case "rosybrown1"), or by using the hex codes of specific colours that we want. You can find R's in built colours from <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf" target="_blank">resources online.</a> 

Each colour has a code, called a “hex code”, a combination of letters and numbers. You can get the codes for different colours online, from Paint, Photoshop or similar programs, or even from RStudio, and we will teach you how to obtain the colours from RStudio using the add-in known as `Colour picker`. I personally like to utilize colour palettes online to decide on the colour schemes, and some really good websites that I use are <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/" target="_blank">Colour Brewer</a> or <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">coolors</a>. Colour brewer even allows you to specify if you want your colour palette to be colourblind safe - which you should definitely do! 

Another thing that we might sometimes want to change is the actual label of the group. In the following example, our dataframe has "Hogsmeade" and "Narnia" specified, and we wouldn't have to change the labls as they would reflect correctly in the legend built by ggplot. However, if it were that they did not have the correct capitalizations, i.e were just listed as "hogsmeade" and "narnia", or were just listed as "group1" and "group2", we would want to have more informative labels, and we can do that by manipulating `labels = c("xxx", "xxx")`. In the example below, we change the labels from the default (taking from the dataframe) of "Hogsmeade" and "Narnia" to "HOGSMEADE" and "NARNIA" just for demonstration purposes. 

`legend.title` allows me to change the font size of the legend, or its formatting e.g. in this case I've made it bold. If we want to change the position of our legend, we can do that with `legend.position`, and here we specify `"bottom"`, but you can also do `legend.position = c(0.1, 0.8)`, which would bring my legend to the top left hand corner of my plot (the 0.1 and 0.8 correspond to x and y values on the graph) - which is a neat trick in some cases where you have lots of blank space within your plot itself. You would have to play around with those values to decide exactly where your legend shows up, and in this case its best to leave it out of the plot due to the lack of white space. 

Finally, we've used `legend.box.background = element_rect()` to create a light grey rectangle that surrounds the legend. If you don't want this, you can just remove that line of code. 

To save our plots, we use the function `ggsave`. where you can specify the dimensions of the plot that you want, and the resolution in which you want to save it at! You could also change the file ending with .png to .pdf to save your image as a whole pdf document. Note that this file would be saved into your working directory - if you've forgotten where that is, you can find it by running the code `getwd()`. If you want it to be saved in a specific folder that is within your working directory, for example into a folder that exists within the working directory itself (e.g. "images"), you can change the code from `ggsave("magical-land-sp-richness.png")` to `ggsave("images/magical-land-sp-richness.png")`, and by adding `images/`, the figure will be saved in that "images" folder. 

```r
(hist <- ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)) + 
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("rosybrown1", "#deebf7"), 
                      breaks = c("Hogsmeade", "Narnia"),
                      labels = c("HOGSMEADE", "NARNIA"), 
                      name = "Land of Magic") +                
    labs(title = "Species richness by plot", 
         x = "\n Plot number", y = "Number of species \n") + 
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), 
          axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
          axis.title = element_text(size = 12), 
          plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"), 
          plot.margin = unit(c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5), units = , "cm"), 
	  legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
          legend.position = "bottom", 
          legend.box.background = element_rect(color = "grey", size = 0.3)))
	  
ggsave("magical-sp-rich-hist.png", width = 7, height = 5, dpi = 300)

```

Congratulations - you've made a beautiful graph! :-)

<a name="boxplot"></a>

## 5. Customizing boxplots in `ggplot2`

We could also plot the data using box plots. That sometimes looks better as it makes more efficient use of space than bars and can reflect errors in nice ways. 

For this we will slightly reshape the dataset to take account of year as well. For more information on data manipulation using `dplyr` and pipes `%>%`, you can check out our <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/01/16/piping.html" target="_blank">data formatting and manipulation tutorial</a>.


```r
yearly_counts <- magic_veg %>%
  group_by(land, plot, year) %>%  # We've added in year here
  summarise(Species_number = length(unique(species))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(plot = as.factor(plot))
```

We plot the basic boxplot without all the extra beautification we've just learnt about to first look at the trends. 

```
(boxplot <- ggplot(yearly_counts, aes(plot, Species_number, fill = land)) +
  geom_boxplot())
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/boxbase.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/> </center>

This does a much nicer job of showing which plots are the most species rich. With the beautifying customisations we've just learnt, we can apply the same to this boxplot! 

```r
(boxplot <- ggplot(yearly_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = 1:6) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("rosybrown1", "#deebf7"),
                    breaks = c("Hogsmeade","Narnia"),
                    name="Land of magic",
                    labels=c("Hogsmeade", "Narnia")) +
  labs(title = "Species richness by plot", 
       x = "\n Plot number", y = "Number of species \n") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme() + 
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12), 
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"), 
        plot.margin = unit(c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5), units = , "cm"), 
        legend.position = "bottom", 
        legend.box.background = element_rect(color = "grey", size = 0.3)))
	
# Saving the boxplot
ggsave("magical-sp-rich-boxplot1.png", width = 7, height = 5, dpi = 300)

```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/boxbeaut1.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/> </center>

If I wanted to have Narnia come before Hogsmeade, I would first have to reorder the data in the dataframe - from this point after reordering the data, ggplot will always plot Narnia before Hogsmeade. Also note how we've changed the order of things in `scale_fill_manual` - above we had it as "Hogsmeade", then "Narnia", and now we have "Narnia" come before "Hogsmeade" - this would be such that the change in order is also reflected in my legend. 

```r
# Reordering the data
yearly_counts$land <- factor(yearly_counts$land, 
                             levels = c("Narnia", "Hogsmeade"),
                             labels = c("Narnia", "Hogsmeade"))

# Plotting the boxplot 
(boxplot <- ggplot(yearly_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_x_discrete(breaks = 1:6) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("#deebf7", "rosybrown1"),
                      breaks = c("Narnia","Hogsmeade"),
                      name = "Land of magic",
                      labels = c("Narnia", "Hogsmeade")) +
    labs(title = "Species richness by plot", 
         x = "\n Plot number", y = "Number of species \n") + 
    theme_bw() + 
    theme() + 
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), 
          axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
          axis.title = element_text(size = 12), 
          plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"), 
          plot.margin = unit(c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5), units = , "cm"), 
          legend.position = "bottom", 
          legend.box.background = element_rect(color = "grey", size = 0.3)))
	
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/boxbeaut2.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/> </center>

If I wanted to reorder the y axis of plot numbers, such that the boxplot for plot 6 comes before 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5, I can use the same principle. Again, from this point on, ggplot will always plot plot 6 before the rest. If I want to change this back to what it was before, I would have to reload the bit of code where we were creating the `yearly_count` object at the start of this section. 

```r
# Reordering the data 
yearly_counts$plot <- factor(yearly_counts$plot, 
                             levels = c("6", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5"),
                             labels = c("6", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5"))

# Plotting the boxplot 
(boxplot2 <- ggplot(yearly_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_x_discrete(breaks = 1:6) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("#deebf7", "rosybrown1"),
                      breaks = c("Narnia","Hogsmeade"),
                      name = "Land of magic",
                      labels = c("Narnia", "Hogsmeade")) +
    labs(title = "Species richness by plot", 
         x = "\n Plot number", y = "Number of species \n") + 
    theme_bw() + 
    theme() + 
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), 
          axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
          axis.title = element_text(size = 12), 
          plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"), 
          plot.margin = unit(c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5), units = , "cm"), 
          legend.position = "bottom", 
          legend.box.background = element_rect(color = "grey", size = 0.3)))

Great - we've now learnt how to beautify our boxplots! 

<a name="mixed"></a>

## 6. Plot results from mixed effects models

We are now going to look at another aspect of the data - the plant heights. First there is a little bit of data manipulations to extract just the height variables:

```r
heights <- magic_veg %>%
  filter(!is.na(height)) %>%  
  group_by(year, land, plot, id) %>%
  summarise(Max_Height = max(height)) %>%  # Calculating max height
  ungroup() %>%  # Need to ungroup so that the pipe doesn't get confused
  group_by(year, land, plot) %>%
  summarise(Height = mean(Max_Height))  # Calculating mean max height
```

We can view this as a basic scatterplot in `ggplot2`:

```r
ggplot(heights, aes(year, Height, colour = land)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()

#You can see there are pretty clear trends over time. We can try to plot a simple line through this:
ggplot(heights, aes(year, Height, colour = land)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm")
```

However, perhaps this isn't what we really want, because you can see the relationship isn't linear. An alternative would be to use a different smoothing equation. Here we've used a quadratic fit - something slightly more complicated to produce than the standard fits provided by R. Thankfully `ggplot2` lets us customise to pretty much any type of fit we want as we can add in an equation to tell it what to plot. There are also loads of different base fits available, you can check out some [here.](http://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/faq/how-can-i-explore-different-smooths-in-ggplot2/)

```r
ggplot(heights, aes(year, Height, colour = land)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x + I(x^2))
```

That looks better. But what if we want to run a mixed model to account for the fact that the data are nested (species within plots within magic lands) and come from different years? For an introduction to linear mixed effects modelling, [check out our tutorial](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/03/15/mixed-models.html). For now, A basic mixed model would look like:

```r
# Using the square brackets to subset the data just for Hogsmeade
lm_heights<-lme(Height ~ year, random = ~1|year/plot, data = heights[heights$land == "Hogsmeade",])
summary(lm_heights)

# Using the square brackets to subset the data just for Narnia
lm_heights2<-lme(Height ~ year, random = ~1|year/plot, data = heights[heights$land == "Narnia",])
summary(lm_heights2)
```

We can't directly plot these models onto the graph, so we need to calculate the predictions that the model has made first. Then we can use those predictions to tell `ggplot2` where to plot the line and the band with the errors. Calculating predictions from your mixed model fit looks really complicated, but really you are just building an empty data frame of all your variables and then using your mixed model to fill it in. The code to do that has to go through several stages and introduces a few scary looking objects, but so long as you make sure the names are consistent you don't need to worry too much about what they are.

__`%*%` is the matrix multiplication operator - you can check out [this webpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication) for more info on matrix multiplication. In brief, to calculate the model predictions we have two matrices and we want to multiply the values from one of columns in the first one by a certain column in the second one (the effect sizes). `plo` refers to the lower end of the uncertainty measure (in our case errors) and `phi` refers to the upper end.__

```r
# Predictions for Hogsmeade
mm.heights <- expand.grid(year = seq(1999, 2016, 1), Height = 0)  # Create a blank dataset with the years we want
mm <- model.matrix(terms(lm_heights), mm.heights)  # Create matrix of relevant effect sizes
mm.heights$Height <- mm %*% fixef(lm_heights)  # Calculate height based on the relevant effect sizes
pvar.mm.heights <- diag(mm %*% tcrossprod(vcov(lm_heights), mm))
mm.heights <- data.frame(mm.heights, plo = mm.heights$Height - 1.96*sqrt(pvar.mm.heights),
                         phi = mm.heights$Height + 1.96*sqrt(pvar.mm.heights))  # Add errors

# Predictions for Narnia
mm.heights2 <- expand.grid(year = seq(1999, 2016, 1), Height = 0)  # Create a blank dataset with the years we want
mm2 <- model.matrix(terms(lm_heights2), mm.heights2)  # Create matrix of relevant effect sizes
mm.heights2$Height <- mm2 %*% fixef(lm_heights2)  # Calculate height based on the relevant effect sizes
pvar.mm.heights2 <- diag(mm2 %*% tcrossprod(vcov(lm_heights2), mm2))
mm.heights2 <- data.frame(mm.heights2, plo = mm.heights2$Height - 1.96*sqrt(pvar.mm.heights2),
                          phi = mm.heights2$Height + 1.96*sqrt(pvar.mm.heights2))  # Add errors
```

__We are now ready to add the line and error for the models to the figure:__

```r
ggplot(heights, aes(year, Height)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = mm.heights, mapping = aes(x = year, ymin = plo, ymax = phi)) +
  geom_line(data = mm.heights, mapping = aes(x = year)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = mm.heights2, mapping = aes(x = year, ymin = plo, ymax = phi)) +
  geom_line(data = mm.heights2, mapping = aes(x = year)) +
  geom_point(data = heights, aes(colour = factor(land))) +
  theme_bw()
```

Here is how our scatterplot has changed so far:

However, we want it to look much prettier, so we will do a new more adjustments.

```r
ggplot(heights, aes(year, Height)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = mm.heights, mapping = aes(x = year, ymin = plo, ymax = phi),
              fill = "purple", alpha = 0.4) +  # Change to coluor and transparency of the error ribbon
  geom_line(data = mm.heights, mapping = aes(x = year),
            colour = "purple", size = 1.5) +  # Change the colour and size of the model line
  geom_ribbon(data = mm.heights2, mapping = aes(x = year, ymin = plo, ymax = phi), fill = "forestgreen", alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_line(data = mm.heights2, mapping = aes(x = year), colour = "forestgreen", size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(data = heights, aes(colour = factor(land)), alpha = 0.6) +  # Add some transparency to the data points
  theme_bw()  +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1999, 2004, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016)) +  # Add all the years
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("purple", "forestgreen"),
                    breaks = c("Hogsmeade", "Narnia"),
                    name="Land of magic",
                    labels=c("Hogsmeade", "Narnia")) +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),  # Make the title bold
        legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(x = "year", y = "Mean Canopy Height") +
  ggtitle ("Change in canopy heights from 1999 - 2016 in the land of magic")
```

## 7. Using the Colour Picker add-in 

Setting custom colours for your graphs can set them apart from all the rest (we all know what the default `ggplot2` colours look like!), make them prettier, and most importantly, give your work a consistent and logical colour scheme. Finding the codes, e.g. `colour="#8B5A00"`, for your chosen colours, however, can be a bit tedious. Though one can always use Paint / Photoshop / google colour codes, there is a way to do this within RStudio thanks to the addin `colourpicker`. RStudio addins are installed the same way as packages, and you can access them by clicking on `Addins` in your RStudio menu. To install `colourpicker`, run the following code:

```r
install.packages("colourpicker")
```

To find out what is the code for a colour you like, click on `Addins/Colour picker`.

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/colourpicker.png" alt="Img" style="width: 800px;"/></center>

When you click on `All R colours` you will see lots of different colours you can choose from - a good colour scheme makes your graph stand out, but of course, don't go crazy with the colours. When you click on `1`, and then on a certain colour, you fill up `1` with that colour, same goes for `2`, `3` - you can add mode colours with the `+`, or delete them by clicking the bin. Once you've made your pick, click `Done`. You will see a line of code `c("#8B5A00", "#CD8500")` appear - in this case, we just need the colour code, so we can copy that, and delete the rest.

## 8. Creating your own ggplot theme

You might have noticed that the lines starting with `theme()` quickly pile up - you can also adjust the font size of the axes and the labels, the position of the title, the background colour of the plot, you can remove the grid lines in the background, etc. And then you have to do the same for the next plot, which really increases the amount of code you use. Here is a simple solution - create a customised theme that combines all the `theme()` elements you want, and apply it to your graphs to make things easier and increase consistency. You can include as many elements in your theme as you want, as long as they don't contradict one another, and then when you apply your theme to a graph, only the relevant elements will be considered - e.g. for our histograms we won't need to use `legend.position`, but it's fine to keep it in the theme, in case any future graphs we apply it to do have the need for legends.

```r
theme_coding <- function(){
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        plot.margin = unit(c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), units = , "cm"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20, vjust = 1, hjust = 0.5),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "italic"),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = c(0.9, 0.9))
}
```

You can try out the effects of the theme by replacing all the code starting with `theme(........)` with just `theme_coding()`.

## Challenge

If you are keen for more practice, you can try visualising the raw data and the predictions from a mixed effect model examining how bare ground cover has changed in our magic lands.

```r
# This is a start to extract the bareground cover data
bareground <- magic_veg %>%
  filter(species == "XXXbareground") %>%
  group_by(land, plot, year) %>%
  summarise(bareground_points = length(species))
```
